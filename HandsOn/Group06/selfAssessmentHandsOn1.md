# Hands-on 1 — Self-Assessment

## What went well
- Teamwork was well organized, tasks divided clearly.
- We found a dataset (Arbolado en parques y zonas verdes de Madrid) that satisfies all mandatory requirements (R1–R4).
- The dataset is rich in geospatial attributes, which makes it easy to link to other datasets.

## What was challenging
- 

## Next steps
- Transform the selected dataset(s) into RDF.
- Link with external datasets such as DBpedia or Wikidata.
