   <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
  <p>The app will display a simple and understandable air quality index (with colors and text labels) along with a health recommendation (“avoid intense outdoor exercise”) and a specific note for sensitive groups (children, elderly, people with asthma).</p>
  <p>Each card will indicate which pollutant triggers the alert, the time of the last measurement, and the distance to the station used.</p>
  <p>A short explanation of what the thresholds mean (WHO/EU references) will be provided, avoiding technical jargon.</p>
  <p>Acceptance criteria: the user understands in ≤15 seconds whether “today is a good/bad day” for outdoor activities and why; source, time, and station are always visible.</p>
  <p>The app will display a map that shows the city with different indications of the corresponding air qualities on different parts of the city.</p>
  <p>Asignal will be sent to the user whenever the app detects an increase in bad air quality on the area where the user resides or is located.</p>
